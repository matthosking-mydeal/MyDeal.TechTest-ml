# MyDeal.com.au Tech Test

Thanks for taking the time to meet with us and discuss a role with the MyDeal.com.au development team. This repository provides a simple application and scenario to help you demonstrate your approach to software development. Short on time? Not a problem - talk to us about other code you might have to submit, or we can also arrange alternative ways for you to show us your knowledge and expertise.

## The Scenario

An "interim" solution has long ago been developed to retrieve user details (imagine it's a more useful application than it is!) and it is now a corner-stone of the business. As a result, we'd like to clean it up and modernise it a bit. However, it was built very quickly and there are a lot of issues to address to make this more maintainable and easier to extend.

## The Challenge

First, identify as many opportunities for improvement as you can and note them down. Second, we'd like to get the solution upgraded to .NET 6 - convert the approaches as required to suit development practices in the latest versions of .NET. Third, select some (or all, time permitting) of the opportunities for improvement that you think represent a good step forward towards reducing the application's technical debt and implement them.

## Submitting

Your checklist for submitting:
1. Make sure everything builds and runs!
2. Make sure the latest commits are pushed to the origin.
3. Add a new markdown file (or update this one) with any notes you want to share.
4. Create a pull request from your branch back to the master branch.
5. Let us know it's done!

## Tips

* Commit a number of times to show your progression.
* Add comments in the code where it's unclear.
* Don't be afraid to leave something for future improvement (and let us know what your thoughts were!)
